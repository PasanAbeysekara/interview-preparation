# What are the main data types in Java?

Java has two types of data types:

-   Primitive types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean
-   Reference types: Objects, Arrays, Interfaces, Enums

# What is the difference between int and Integer?

-   int is a primitive data type.
-   Integer is a wrapper class that allows int to be used as an object and provides utility methods.

# What are the types of operators in Java?

-   Arithmetic (+, -, \*, /, %)
-   Relational (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
-   Logical (&&, ||, !)
-   Bitwise (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
-   Assignment (=, +=, -=, etc.)
-   Unary (+, -, ++, --)
-   Ternary (condition ? true : false)

# Difference between == and .equals() in Java?

-   == checks for reference equality (whether they point to the same object).
-   .equals() checks for content equality, if overridden (e.g., in String).
