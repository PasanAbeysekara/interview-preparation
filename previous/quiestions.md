what type of architecture would you prefer for a given scenario and why"
tcp/ip, garbage collection, gave several complex scenarios for me to write and execute the java code, asked questions on fyp, what happen when compile and run a program, how memory works,
Gave a scenario asked the components and modules
Authorisation and authentication
technologies to be used when developing the application in the scenario
why use those technologies
what is the software archietecture
how will you enhance user experience in the application
database to use for the given scenario and why?
asked about REST
Explain one OOP concept and where you've used it
Showed simple an example on inheritence and asked questions(object instantiation using super class references, whether cross inheritence object creation is allowed or not)
Gave me an example of a farm and animals and asked me to write a code snippet to represent them.(polymorphism and inheritence)
Asked about data structures to store the objects.(hashtables and arraylists)
network questions about how to ensure that the payload is authentic(parity bits)
ACID properties
where to store the primary key in a one to many scenario
write a sql query to a given scenario (sorting)
when to use sql and nosql databases
difference between data definition languages and data manipulation languages
